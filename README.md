I have build this demo to make some notes on RESTful APIs with Python 3 and Flask.

> I have used SQL Lite DB to store the User and Planets information.
> These super simple API example are to remind myself when I need to revisit Flask.
> I used Postman as a front-end
>
> >jsonify used to return JSON instead of text.
